### Purpose of the project

To create an information site for a new start-up food truck business that sells hot chocolates from around the world.

We all know coffee is booming across the world in the way people consume it, feel passionately about it, and generally enjoy it. But what about those who don't like this caffeine infused drink? What about people who can't have caffeine? What drinks options do they have when attending market stalls, events, etc?

Well, enter Culture Choc. A celebration of hot chocolate recipes from around the world that bridges the gap between coffee drinkers and those that don't. Between those who love hot drinks and hate them. Those who want to try something a little more spicy, or just a soothing classic for the day.

There are many kinds of people who may like this concept, but to start with, this business will operate mainly at local food events and private hire. Therefore, the people who visit this place will either have heard about it through social media (which is yet to be established!), by seeing it in person at an event, or word of mouth. Therefore, this project needs to provide those who haven't a clue what it is with more information, those who do know with more detailed information, and those who really love it with an ability to reach out and book an event.

As for real life use, this page will hopefully be used in the real world once this business is operational, as it was "commissioned" by the developers' husband, who is currently putting together the business plan for this. Consider this a sneak preview!

# User experience

## Users

This site will be aimed at three main user groups:
- New customers who want to know more about the business
- Existing customers looking up menu items
- Corporate/events professionals looking for a supplier

#### User stories

1. New customers
- I found this business via google or social media and want to learn more about what it is
- I want to know where I can experience this business
- I want to build an emotional connection with the founder of this business

New customers will land on this page presumably from either a google search or a reference to the business on social media. Therefore the site needs to inform them of what the business proposition is, where they can find the business and also a little bit about the background of the business. The last point will primarily serve to bring a sense of familiarity to the business once customers interact with it. With the street food market, a small sense of ownership of the business, by virtue of knowing how it came to be and its owner helps to build a bond and repeat customership.

2. Existing customers
- I am standing in front of the stall and want to know more about the menu items
- I saw this stall at a previous market and want to know which items they will be serving at the next one
- I want to know where I can find this stall next time

These customers will most likely either have spotted the business at a street food market or have seen the business before and want to check the entire menu ahead of attending an event with the stall in attendance. These customers will be much more interested in the menu side of things, however the locations and which menu items will feature will play an important role in their decision making. With this audience, the key is to relay to them more detailed information about the business so they feel included.

3. Corporate/events professionals
- I want to book a stall for my business event
- I need to make sure it doesn't completely flop
- I want to check if they can fulfil my specific requirements

Arguably, this audience needs the least depth of information. While they will want to scrutinise this business' capability and offering, this will mainly be done by word of mouth from other professionals, and so ultimately, with most business customers, they have a budget and just wish to know that the business is available on their date and fits within that budget. Therefore an easy journey towards submitting an enquiry is key.

## Design

### Colours

This website uses a 4 colour scheme, created based on the fundamental chocolate brown colour with pops of brightness so it can have stand out elements.

Basic brown - #7B5B3D
Dark brown - #402E32
Light gray - #DFE0DF
Mustard yellow - #F1962E

### Typography

This site uses Acme for headings and Cairo for body text. These two complement each other with the curve of their lettering, while the heading font has a higher weight to stand out from the relatively slim body text font. They pair nicely to create a feeling of this place being robust and delicate - just like its chocolates! 
Both of these will default to sans-serif if unavailable.

### Imagery

The imagery used is incredibly important. This site needs to represent both the class of the hot chocolate world while making it feel very approachable and calm. 

The hero image was downloaded from [Pexels](https://www.pexels.com/photo/coffee-dark-candy-chocolate-65882/) and is under Free to use for commercial or personal use purposes. The remainings imagery was all sources by the author of the page themselves and can be used for this project indefinitely.

# Features

Each page features identical navigation features to have consistency of design and user experience, and therefore allow easier navigation across the site. These are:
- Header
The header includes a logo (which is made with text for now) and a navigation bar. The navigation bar features simple links that highlight and underline when hovered for ease of use.
- Footer
The footer once again repeats the logo in the opposite colourway, and features links to other pages that may be useful for that user once they navigate to the bottom of each page. These include Menu links, Private hire link and social media links. 
All social media links are NOT functioning right now, however the icons serve as placeholders for future links, should the business set up social media.

### Home page
The home page features 6 elements in total.

1. Header  
As described in static elements above.

2. Hero image and overlay  
This element is designed to draw the customer in and give them a feeling of luxury for this stall. It features a bold image of chocolate with an overlay of large heading that creates a nice focal point.

3. Introduction text  
This text introduces a new and existing visitor to the page and the concept of Culture Choc. This also helps to guide users through the other pages available to them. Icons are used to help break up the text visually.

4. Locations  
This elements repeats on a couple of pages and gives users a really quick insight into where this stall will be visiting - the general geographical town, date and name of the event. This is to help users quickly determine if this will be close enough to them to be possible.

5. Bio of founder  
This section has a quick text snippet about the founder and an image. This is designed to appeal by ceeating a real human behind the brand.

6. Footer  
The footer has an inverse logo and a few links to help guide the user further around the site. This is the same across the entire website.

### Menu page

The menu page has 4 elements for simplicity. This page is designed as a landing page for someone physically at the stall as a reference, so it is designed to be as simple as possible, while also providing some background information for those not physically present at the stall.

1. Header  
Standardised as described above.

2. Introduction text  
This has some simple information that gives context as to how the menu operates, in case that wasn't given to people in person.

3. Menu items  
These items are designed to be a pop of colour while conveying information in a simple way. Each hot chocolate is given the country of origin, simple strapline, image which roughly describes the breakdown of ingredients with an ingredients list alongside (which drops below on responsive). These items are aligned in two rows but can be expanded upon easily with further rows should the menu expand in the future.

4. Footer  
Standard as described above.

### Private hire page

This page consists of 5 elements, 4 of which are recurring from other pages.

1. Header  
As described previously.

2. Form  
The form is a simple data entry form with a little bit of context. This is designed to make it easy for those who need to ask question to simply ask them. The placeholder text has been personalised to give some personality!

3. Locations  
In case the person who has a question wants to see the stall in person to decide on it's validity and worthiness of interest, they can quickly see where they can see this. This is an element exactly repeated from the homepage, but can be personalised if corporate events should be added instead of generic ones for reference.

4. Bio  
Once again, a quick note and picture helps to bring the stall to life.

5. Footer  
Repeated as on all other pages.

### Form submission page

This is just a really quick splash page to give immediate feedback to the user upon filling in the form. 

1. Header  
As in all pages. Allows user to navigate back to the website after submitting form.

2. Message  
Just a thank you message with set expectations as to response times.

3. Footer  
Repeats as per other pages.

### Future development / regrets

Overall, my biggest regret was in not making the burger collapse menu work across the site. After trying in the way we did in the Love Runnings project, then studying the paperwork for Bootstrap 5.1 to see if that would have a workaround - nothing would stick. It would either create the icon but then not work, or the icon would be invisible, it would pop out of the header... after spending many hours, I decided to change course and try to just make it work with text still visible, rather than waste any more time.

1. Home page  
I feel that the general introduction text and feel of the home page could be improved. The introduction text could do with more breaking up, maybe imagery once the stall is up and running, something to bring a sense of community to the Chocolate Revolution we describe.

2. Menu page  
The menu items are fine, but the intention was for the images of each item to be more detailed, have more visual impact, with the custom images to have more depth with colour, ingredient description, etc. Also once the stall is up and running, the ability to update the menu line up for each event so bring the location element through to here. At this point, I didn't bring the location element into menu as I used the same styling and it would need a lot of personalisation that wasn't needed just for the information.

3. Private hire page  
This page could do with the most expansion. The original intention, as visible on wireframes, was to have a Video Testimonial sitting under the form for verification of the services. However I ran out of time to create and edit this video myself and an existing one isn't available.   
Additionally, an FAQ page would probably help with some quick questions certain corporate or private clients may have (Do you cater weddings? Is there a minimum order? etc.).

But overall, as a comment, I am incredibly proud of everything I've done on this page and how it works and just how close I got to my original wireframe designs!

# Technologies used

## Languages used
HTML5 and CSS3

## Frameworks, libraries and programmes

1. Bootstrap 5.1  
I used the latest stable version of Bootstrap 5 to assist with the layout of the site and certain elements, such as the header and footer.

2. Google Fonts  
I utilised the Google fonts library to import Acme and Cairo fonts.

3. Font Awesome  
I used icons for the social media links in the footer.

4. GitPod  
Used to create the code and sync to GitHub to push and commit.

5. GitHub  
GitHub is used to store the code and repositories.

6. Adobe Illustrator  
I used Adobe Illustrator to create the wireframes and the custom graphics on the page as I was very familiar with Illustrator through work and therefore was able to create these quickly and in a way that was useful to me.

7. Am I responsive?  
This website was used to generate the responsive look image at the top of the README.

## Code

My basic structure was heavily influenced by the Love Running project and I utilised elements from this project on my Repl.it. These elements are: Nav bar styling, hero image overlay at the top of the Index page and icons for social media in footer.

## Bugs

1. Footer loses background color when responsive settings kick in.  
    1. The footer did not have a set height, instead relying on Auto. This caused it to not have a size as such to apply settings to. This was fixed by adding heights, both for regular view and mobile view. Proper height was determined using DevTools.

2. Footer isn't at the bottom on form submission page.  
    1. This was hacked together by applying a class to the footer on the form submission page in particular and adding a position absolute value to it. This styling wasn't applied to the entire page as it interfered with the layout of the pages with more content. 

3. Locations and menu items collapse haphazardly in mobile view.  
    1. Changing the styling of these elements using a custom class specifically for responsive view (@media max-width 767.98px) so that the flex-direction was changed to column fixed this issue whereby the individual boxes stack on top of one another.

4. Header as fixed at top of page caused elements to overlap.  
    1. Embarrassed it took me this long to figure out, but just had to add a margin to the top of the following element and then amend this margin for responsive view. The solution came to me when I was using DevTools and experimenting.

## Testing

### Code validation

All code was run through W3 validators for [HTML](https://validator.w3.org/nu/) and [CSS](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/validator) and the Lighthouse validator in Google DevTools.

#### HTML validator
HTML tests revealed issues with my use of alt/aria-label tags (which I now realise was a misunderstanding of their use in my knowledge) as well as use of span instead of div in header and footer stylings. My index page hero overlay was also using styling of H1 elements, where it should've used another as it was not the top level heading. Finally, a stray section was discovered in my hire page.

#### CSS validator
CSS tests revealed no errors, however did warn that import links (for my Google fonts) couldn't be validated.

#### Lighthouse
1. Home page  Home page validation received a green score in all elements except performance. This is due to a couple of images using, what I now learn, are out of date image files (PNG). There is also apparently an unset height and width for an image, however I have set the height and left the width to auto to avoid distorting the image.

2. Menu page   The menu page received green scores across the board

3. Private hire page  The private hire page received green scores across the board

4. Form submission page  This page had green scores apart from in SEO, where it determined that the standard bootstrap/js links were unnecessary. I'm leaving them just for safety.

### Browser validation

I tested the site on Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox and Microsoft Edge.

The site worked fine in Google Chrome and Mozilla Firefox, however loaded quite slowly on Microsoft Edge.

### Manual testing

This page was frequently tested through Google DevTools on the browser, using the Inspect tool. This was used to test changes, apply small incremental fixes, or even experiment with options using the visual feedback as testing. 
Through this manual testing I discovered that the page started to degrade in performance only below a width of 767.98px, therefore I chose not to create any custom styling for sizes above that. 

### Features testing

Repeating elements  

- Header - works fine and menu shifts underneath the logo when the size needs it. The text also has responsive sizing.  
- Locations - this feature took a little while to figure out so it would collapse properly however it now works, it displays the information needed across the two sites identically and it shifts the boxes underneath itself at sizes when needed. The image also shifts above ingredients when the size gets too small.  
- Bio section - this one was a tough nut to crack! In testing, this feature differed on the home and private hire pages, but this was discovered as a discrepancy in code and amended to work. Once that was sorted, the image needed more breathing room and a margin change to fit under the text and above the footer in both applications. It now works to collapse when needed and is legible.  
- Footer - This took a lot of testing as changes across the page meant that the elements would shift, the background would disappear, etc. However once I set a height and width for this (which, in a lot of cases, wasn't auto!) this does work to collapse with text popping underneath the logo once it gets smaller. There are still times when the footer is too big, or the gap below it appears, however it functions and gives users the ability to navigate across the site. The social media icons in the footer are NOT linked in this project but have the space to do so when these social channels exist.  

Home page unique elements  

- Introduction text - this adds padding once fully collapsed to mobile view and the icons work responsively as they have responsive sizing. 

Menu unique elements

- Introduction text - works as needed, font size was increased once at mobile view after testing with my mentor. 
- Menu - this took some figuring out, however all the elements now stack responsively as the screen size changes and the image jumps above the ingredients when needed.

Private hire unique elements

- Form - the form did have trouble when goign to mobile in overlapping the page, however it now has a set width at smaller screen sizes which has fixed the issue.

Form submission page unique elements

- Text - needed some adjustment when resized due to the line height setting but now works well.

### User stories testing

1. New customers  
- I found this business via google or social media and want to learn more about what it is  
The landing page for the website extensively describes the purpose of the business, what other information can be found and also a profile of the founder.

- I want to know where I can experience this business  
The landing and private hire pages include a locations section which outlines which markets this stall will attend. The footer also includes links to social media pages.

- I want to build an emotional connection with the founder of this business  
The landing and private hire pages include a short profile of the founder.

2. Existing customers  
- I am standing in front of the stall and want to know more about the menu items  
The menu page can be linked to directly and has a breakdown of each of the menu items on offer.

- I saw this stall at a previous market and want to know which items they will be serving at the next one  
The landing page includes a panel of future market stall locations as well as social media links for further information.

- I want to know where I can find this stall next time  
The landing page includes a breakdown of future locations, which can be expanded upon if further markets are available. There are also links to social media which can be used to contact the operator directly.

3. Corporate/events professionals  
- I want to book a stall for my business event  
The private hire page hosts an enquiry form which can be used to contact the owner.

- I need to make sure it doesn't completely flop  
The private hire page includes location information so the potential customer can visit the stall and see it in action.

- I want to check if they can fulfil my specific requirements  
The page hosts an enquiry form which can be used to ask specific questions.

## Credit

As mentioned previously, I utilised elements from the Love Running project earlier on in the course.

I also frequently consulted W3 schools and Stack Overflow to better understand if elements weren't working well or how I intended them to. This helped me to better understand the little features.

Finally, the Bootstrap library was absolutely instrumental in understanding this complex piece of kit that is so frequently used.

## Feedback

Koko, mentor - Commit history is lacking as ommits should be made much more frequently. I have completely taken this feedback on board, and feel a bit foolish for forgetting this. I applied this to my final small changes before submitting to demonstrate that I recognise this.

## Acknowledgments

Koko, my mentor - thank you every so much for all the time you spent with me to make sure I got this right. Truly would not be the project it is without you, and I am so grateful for your time. And also for the fun we had!

Alex, my husband - without your support, I would never have had any time to do this project and the course, as I would've had to wrangle my 1.5 year old... that was not on the cards.

Everyone who has ever written anything that simplified how code is used - my eternal gratitude for making this field of work feel accessible and less scary.
